<!-- towncrier release notes start -->

## 0.4.0 - 2026-04-13

### Added

- Linux releases now include a `.deb` package built in GitHub Actions, making Ubuntu and Debian installs part of the standard release flow instead of a local-only packaging path.

### Fixed

- Linux development runs and packaged builds now restore the PTY native module correctly under Electron 36, fixing the startup crash that was falling back to a missing `build/Release/pty.node` binary.
- Native runtime preparation no longer uses a shared temporary Electron ABI probe file, preventing concurrent `npm run` flows from failing with a missing-module error during startup or packaging.
- Terminal panes now detect web links and open them on modifier-click, preserving normal click and selection behavior for non-activated links.
- Vibe99 now ships with the new branded application icon across packaged app assets and installer output.

### Misc

- Local packaging commands now fail fast on unsupported Node versions, and the repo pins Node 22 so macOS release builds use a known-good toolchain.


## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-11

### Fixed

- Display settings now persist across app restarts instead of resetting to the defaults every time Vibe99 launches.
- Right-click menus now work for terminals and tabs, and terminal copy and paste shortcuts follow the usual platform conventions.

### Misc

- Repository structure cleanup.


## 0.2.0 - 2026-04-11

### Added

- The first packaged macOS release is now available, with DMG and ZIP artifacts produced by Electron Forge.

### Fixed

- Closing the last application window now quits the app instead of leaving Vibe99 running in the background.
- Packaged builds now spawn terminal sessions correctly by using a prebuilt multi-architecture PTY dependency and unpacking its macOS helper binary.
