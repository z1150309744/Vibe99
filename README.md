  Desktop terminal workspace for agentic coding.
</p>

Vibe99 is a Tauri desktop terminal workspace for agentic coding. It is built for the common case where one terminal needs full attention while several others only need peripheral visibility, so the UI keeps one pane readable and stacks the rest so you can still see what agents are doing.

## Quick Start

Install dependencies and start the Tauri dev app from this repository:

```bash
npm install
npm run tauri:dev
```

`npm run tauri:dev` starts Vite on `http://localhost:1420` and then launches the native Tauri shell. If Cargo is too old, update Rust with:

```bash
rustup update stable
```

Build release artifacts with:

```bash
npm run tauri:build
```

## Features

- **Custom pane colors** — each pane can have its own accent color for quick visual identification.
- **Activity alerts** — backgrounded panes with settled output show a pulsing breathing mask, with global and per-pane toggles.
- **Command palette** — quick tab switching via a searchable palette.
- **Configurable shortcuts** — keyboard shortcuts can be edited in the settings modal.
- **Session restore** — pane layout, directories, shell profiles, and tab titles are preserved across restarts.
- **WSL integration** — auto-detects all installed distributions and creates a shell profile for each one.
- **Font selection** — pick any installed monospace font from settings.

## Controls

| Shortcut | Action |
|---|---|
| `Cmd+T` / `Ctrl+T` | Add a new pane |
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Cycle to the most recently visited pane (add `Shift` to reverse) |
| `Ctrl+Left` / `Ctrl+Right` | Spatial navigation between panes |
| `Ctrl+B` | Enter navigation mode (`H`/`L` or arrows to move, `Enter` to focus) |
| double-click tab | Rename it |
| drag tab | Reorder panes |
| top-right `+` | Add a pane |
| top-right gear | Open display settings |

## Platform Defaults And Known Issues

- Terminal font defaults are platform-aware: `Consolas` on Windows, `Menlo` on macOS, and `DejaVu Sans Mono` on Linux.
- WSL integration is available on Windows and is a no-op on macOS/Linux.
- Known issue: the native macOS title bar can remain light while the system is in dark mode. See [issue #28](https://github.com/NekoApocalypse/Vibe99/issues/28).
